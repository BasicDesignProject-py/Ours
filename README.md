# Basic Design Project (Python - Cats And Dogs)

"""
This program will be able to detect two different types of animals in one same picture, cats and dogs.
For this, we will be in need of the OpenCV library, and we are planning to concentrate on Numpy and CV2.

Flow Chart:
01 - Start
02 - Ask a user to log in (or sign up if the one has no accounts)
03 - Ask a user to upload the pic containing various animals
04 - If there are cats and dogs: Show the result
     If there is no cat or dog: Output "No desired animal found"
05 - Finish
