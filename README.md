# Basic Design Project (Python - Cats And Dogs)

"""
This program will be able to detect two different types of animals in one same picture, cats and dogs.
For this, we will be in need of the OpenCV library, and we are planning to concentrate on Numpy and CV2.

Flow Chart:
01 - Start
02 - Ask a user to log in (or sign up if the one has no accounts)
03 - Ask a user to upload the pic containing various animals
04 - If there are cats and dogs: Show the result
     If there is no cat or dog: Output "No desired animal found"
05 - Finish

To make the program work, we will need some knowledges about OpenCV (which includes Numpy and CV2) library.

As our adviser told us, we are able to write the codes in C language.
Min is learning the OpenCV libraries (cv2, numpy). He is active.
Alsaba is learning Python. She is active also.
Next weekend (or after) we are planning to have a small meeting, checking each others progress level and results.
Soon will be some more updates.
